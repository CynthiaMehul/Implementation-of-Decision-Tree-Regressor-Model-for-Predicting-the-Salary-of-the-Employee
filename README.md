# Implementation-of-Decision-Tree-Regressor-Model-for-Predicting-the-Salary-of-the-Employee

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the Decision Tree Regressor Model for Predicting the Salary of the Employee.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
Step 1: Start.
Step 2: Import required libraries
Step 3: Add the csv file with the data. 
Step 4: Process the data before training using Label Encoder.
Step 5: Specify x and y values.
Step 6: Split your data for training and testing.
Step 7: Train your model with inbuilt function DecisionTreeRegressor()
Step 8: Find y predicted value and mean squared error.
Step 9: Print the required values.
Step 10: End.
